Plugin to find unused css names in current active css file. Searches for all id and class names inside current open project or file directory if no project is currently open. All css names that do not occur once in any other .php, .html, .xhtml or .js file is highlighted.

Might run slow on big projects, do not hesitate to send me improvement recommendations as this is my first sublime plugin.
